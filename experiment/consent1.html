<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Project Title: </strong>Individual Differences in Reading Comprehension&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><strong>Principal Investigator (PI): </strong>Dr. Karen Campbell, Department of Psychology, Brock University,&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;"><a href="tel:905-668-5550">905-668-5550</a> ext. 4281, <a href="mailto:karen.campbell@brocku.ca">karen.campbell@brocku.ca</a></span></span></div>

<div><strong><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Student Investigator:&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></span></strong><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Emily Davis, Department of Psychology, Brock University, <a href="mailto:edavis2@brocku.ca">edavis2@brocku.ca</a></span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">INVITATION</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">You are invited to participate in a research project designed to learn about reading comprehension and aging. The task is expected to take 60 minutes. We will pay $5 per 30 minutes of your time.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">WHAT&rsquo;S INVOLVED</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">You will be asked to read a series of short stories one sentence at a time, pressing a key after each sentence to proceed. Following the stories, you will be asked some questions, for which specific instructions will be given. We will test you on your working memory capacity (i.e., ability to hold information in mind temporarily), vocabulary, and other personal characteristics.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">When you are finished, you will be told more information about the study and provided further information on how to contact the researchers if you have any questions.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">POTENTIAL BENEFITS AND RISKS</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Potential risks include fatigue and minor anxiety about task performance. To minimize these risks, regular breaks will be provided. It is important to note that your performance on this task is not indicative of overall cognitive ability. Possible benefits include gaining knowledge of how experiments are run in psychology and how cognition is affected by age. You will also contribute to our further understanding of how the mind and brain change with normal, healthy aging.</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">CONFIDENTIALITY</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">All information you provide is considered confidential; your name will not be included with your data. Your data file will not be seen by anyone outside of the research team. &nbsp;Furthermore, because our interest is in the average responses of the entire group of participants, you will not be identified individually in any way in written reports of this research. We will keep a list of participants to ensure that each participant does not take part in the study more than once which will be kept for 7 years, and this information will not be connected to your responses in the study.</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Data collected during this study will be stored in the laboratory of Dr. Karen Campbell, which will always be secured. De-identified data (i.e., scores on the tasks that cannot be linked to your name) will be kept for five years following publication in an academic journal, after which time all data will be destroyed by deleting electronic records. Access to this data will be restricted to Dr. Karen Campbell and research assistants in Dr. Campbell&rsquo;s laboratory (all of whom will agree to maintain confidentiality).&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Participation in this study is voluntary and participants have the right to request the withdrawal of their data. If you wish, you may decline to answer any questions or participants in any component of the study. Further, you may decide to withdraw from this study at any time. If you decide to withdraw from the research study, you will not be paid for your session. If you choose to withdraw after some data have been collected, acquired data will be destroyed and deleted from our records. Please note that once the experiment is completed, there is no way of connecting your identity with your data, and therefore it is not possible to remove your responses should you wish to withdraw after completing your session.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">PUBLICATION OF RESULTS</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">Results of this study may be published in professional journals and presented at conferences. While we cannot provide individual feedback to participants, general feedback about this study will be available as soon as data collection is complete in approximately one year. If you are interested in receiving feedback about the results of the study, please indicate below and Dr. Karen Campbell will send you a copy of the findings.&nbsp;</span></span></div>

<div>&nbsp;</div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">CONTACT INFORMATION AND ETHICS CLEARANCE</span></span></div>

<div><span style="font-family:Times New Roman,Times,serif;"><span style="font-size:16px;">If you have any questions about this study or require further information, please contact our lab at <a href="mailto:brockcnalab@brocku.ca">brockcnalab@brocku.ca</a> who will connect you with our researchers. This study has been reviewed and received ethics clearance through the Research Ethics Board at Brock University 19-352. If you have any comments or concerns about your rights as a research participant, please contact the Research Ethics Office at <a href="tel:(905) 688-5550">(905) 688-5550</a> Ext. 3035, <a href="mailto:reb@brocku.ca">reb@brocku.ca.</a></span></span></div>
